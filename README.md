## Geomorphic Covariance Structure (GCS) analysis GUI

### Package contents
- Graphic user interface executable script (gcs_gui.py)
- Python files defining GUi implemented function/methods
- Copy of RapidLasso's LAStools software (http://lastools.org/)
- Copy of 'Breeze' GUI theme (https://github.com/MaxPerl/ttk-Breeze)

### Pre-requisite packages
- arcpy (+ Spatial Analyst licence)
-- Comes with ArcGIS Python 3 default environment. 
  Clone environment to enable external package installation. 
- pillow (https://python-pillow.org/)
- plotly (https://plotly.com/)
- seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

### Setting up -- Create a folder containing following:
- LAS/LAZ point cloud data files with spatial extents/footprint that
  capture a river valley's in-channel topography. 
  - Either bathymetric LiDAR or traditional LiDAR collected during dry channel conditions.
- Any shapefile (.shp) from the LiDAR project's metadata that has a spatial reference frame matching the point cloud data.
  - Can also be manually created based on project metadata files.
- A shapefile (.shp) defining the analysis area of interest (AOI).
  -   Projected in a spatial reference frame with desired analysis units (Meters 
      or US Feet)This shapefile's spatial reference is applied to all output  files.
- A folder (within the top level directory) containing only 4-band, 1m- resolution
  NAIP imagery .jp2 files that cover the AOI. 


### Literature 
This package applies a GCS analysis that has been refined over the
past decade. The applied methodology is described in  detail, as well as linked to known hydro-
morphodynamic fluvial mechanisms, within the following publications (in chronological order):

## Using the GUI
The GUI has seven tabs, each enabling different segments of the GCS analysis methodology.
The tabs are designed to be ran sequentially, and in some cases require manual inputs or inspection between them.
The outputs of a step/tab are typically the inputs of the next one. Do not alter the file
structure that is automatically generated by this package, as this can introduce errors or bugs.
The sections below describe the goals, inputs, outputs, and user requirements associated with each step of the analysis.
Different user choices can effect the final analysis results in relevant ways, therefore we recomended referencing this
guide prior to any choosing parameters or manually editing shapefiles.


#### Tab 1 -- Prepping LiDAR data from processing
Overview: LiDAR data point files are prepared for LAStools vegetation point removal. NAIP imagery is used to generate 
a NDVI raster and create a polygon representing non-vegetated bare-ground.
 
Inputs:
- The directory containing river valley LiDAR point cloud files (see 'Setting up')
- The directory containing NAIP imagery (see 'Setting up')
- A shapefile with the LiDAR project's spatial reference frame (see 'Setting up')
- A shapefile defining the area of interest in the desired output spatial reference frame (see 'Setting up')
  - This shapefile should be manually edited to somewhat tightly surround the river channel and flood-plain.
  - Do not exclude any areas that could be submerged under flood stage flows, but excess AOI coverage will substantially 
    slow the LiDAR processing step.
  - Define the shapefile's spatial reference frame (including vertical). This will be the reference frame 
    of all output files, and defines the units used within the analysis.
- NDVI threshold (default is 0.4)
  - NDVI = Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index)
  - The threshold corresponds to the minimum NDVI value that gets defined as vegetation.
  - In arid regions, lower values may be required (0.15-0.3).
  - **USER INPUT :** Inspect the 'veg_poly.shp' file within the output folder. Verify vegetation mask
    quality. Adjust NDVI value and run again if necessary.

Relevant outputs: 
- A shapefile representing bare-ground -- ground_poly.shp 
- A shapefile representing the LiDAR data extent -- las_footprint.shp
